<strong>Key Information about this research study:</strong>
<p>
	The following is a short summary of this study to help you decide whether to be a part of this study. Information that is more detailed is listed later on in this form. 
</p>
<p>
	The purpose of this study is learn how people perceive the prosodic features of speech in their native language. You will be asked to listen to recorded samples of English speech and rate words and phrases in the speech for qualities you perceived related to the prominence of words or phrases, the chunking of speech into phrases, or qualities related to the speaker such as “politeness”. 
</p>
</p>
	We expect that you will be in this research study for 30-45 minutes. There are no risks associated with participation in the proposed research beyond what you experience from using a computer in everyday life, or boredom. The main benefit is the satisfaction of contributing to linguists’ knowledge concerning the speech perception system.
</p>
<strong>Why am I being asked to take part in this research study?</strong>
<p>
	We are asking you to take part in this research study because you are a monolingual speaker of American English between the ages of 18-55, with no known deficits in speech, hearing or reading, and with normal or corrected-to-normal vision.
</p>
<strong>How many people will be in this study?</strong>
<p>
	We expect about 30 people here will be in this research study.
</p>
<strong>What should I know about participating in a research study?</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Whether or not you take part is up to you.</li>
	<li>You can choose not to take part.</li>
	<li>You can agree to take part and later change your mind.</li>
	<li>Your decision will not be held against you.</li>
	<li>You can ask all the questions you want before you decide.</li>
</ul>

<strong>What happens if I say, “Yes, I want to be in this research”?</strong>
<p>
	If you agree to participate, you will complete a language background questionnaire, and rate or identifiy qualities related to prosody that you hear in the words and phrases of recorded samples of English. You will enter your responses by clicking on the words corresponding to the speech you hear, as presented on the computer screen. You will advance through the experiment at your own pace. The first speech sample you hear will be a training example, to familiarize you with the speech materials and experimental task. The experiment will take place in one session and will last no longer than 45 minutes. You will participate in the experiment remotely, using your computer and your headphones, in a quiet location of your choosing. You will not directly interact with any member of the study team.
